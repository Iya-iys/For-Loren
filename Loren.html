<h3>

I know you have more than one favorite song, but this one is also mine because it brings me memories of you.

Do not bear your burdens alone anymore. I see that you're hurting and fighting, and it hurts me that you're crying silently. You don't need to keep it all inside. I love you, and I care about you. Let me be there for you. Talk to me.

Tell me your fears and concerns because my love for you is greater than your problems.</h3>
