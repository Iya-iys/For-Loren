    <h4>
     Whenever the world seems too hard to bear or when your life is full of challenges that are seemingly impossible to overcome, and you need support or reassurance, remember, you can always find it from me. Let it be known, I am available to you and willing to hear you out as well as offer comfort when needed mostâ€”I shall be your cry shoulder during grief. Whatever challenges life brings to our doorstep, whatever battles we might have to endure, rely on me and I shall never leave your side. Whenever you need to reach out, you can come running to me without fear. I can be your sanctuary, your "pahinga," where you can discover the peace and comfort you are looking for. You are never alone in this walk; I will always be there to help you in any way I can.
